Four layer feed forward neural network to predict stock directions based off previous data.

To run this locally, make sure to set MARKETDATADIR as a local environmental variable pointing to the path leading to Market_Data, by for instance opening "vim .bash_profile" and typing "export MARKETDATADIR='[path/name/goes/here]'".
